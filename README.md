# Access to Affordable Finance for Young Agripreneurs in Nigeria

This project was developed during a 12-day hackathon focused on solving one of Nigeriaâ€™s critical challenges: **limited access to finance for young agripreneurs**. Using real data, we built a data-driven solution to uncover key patterns, profile farmers, and support decision-making for financial inclusion.

##  Problem Statement

Access to affordable finance remains a major barrier preventing young Nigerians from entering and scaling in agriculture. While the sector employs 35% of the workforce, only a small portion of rural youth have access to formal loans or financial services.

Our goal: **use data to bridge this finance gap and help banks/investors identify creditworthy young farmers.**

##  Objectives

- Identify factors that make farmers "creditworthy"
- Predict loan repayment likelihood or business success
- Develop a prototype dashboard for financial institutions and farmer profiling

---

##  Datasets

- **World Bank Agriculture and Demographics Data**
General Household Survey, Panel 2018-2019, Wave 4
Nigeria, 2018 - 2019

##  Tools Used

- Power BI (EDA, dashboard)
- Power Query (data cleaning , shaping)
- Python (optional for modeling)
- Git & GitHub (version control)
